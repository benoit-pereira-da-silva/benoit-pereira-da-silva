# Benoit Pereira da Silva

Software engineer · coding since 1984.

Working on **[Organic Programming](https://github.com/benoit-pereira-da-silva/organic-programming)** — a methodology where any program, on any platform, in any language, can become a typed, composable unit through Protocol Buffers and gRPC.

The approach draws on the Unix philosophy (small tools, composition, text streams) and extends it with typed contracts, automatic CLI adoption, and a framework for human-AI collaboration.

Published under the pseudonym **B. ALTER**.
